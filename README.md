# Cancer-Prediction
Breast cancer is one of the most widespread diseases among women worldwide. Correct and early diagnosis is an extremely important step in rehabilitation and treatment. However, it is not an easy one due to several uncertainties in detection using mammograms. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to develop tools for physicians that can be used as an effective mechanism for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer which will greatly enhance the survival rate of patients. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer. A few machine learning techniques will be explored to test the accuracy of the model
